# Game Title Here

**Sincere Singularities** Python Discord Summer CodeJam 2024 project.
The technology is **Discord Application**, the theme is **Information Overload**, and our chosen framework is [Disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake/).

---

Did you ever want to experience the information overload and stress of a phone operator?
Well, then you're at the right place!

We've created a first stressful Discord game, in which you play a phone operator for a restaurant.
No matter what dishes, customers, or special orders you have to serve, don't lose focus, or you might get overwhelmed by the information overload!

## Running the bot

1. Python 3.11 is [recommended](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake/pull/1135#issuecomment-1847303628).
2. Install the Game:
    ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/SincereSingularities/SincereSingularities/
   cd SincereSingularities
   pip install -e .
    ```
3. Setup a [Discord Bot](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/stable/discord.html). <!-- TODO: explain better once we have an idea on how the bot works (e.g. what permissions are required) -->
4. Set the `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable to your Token using the `.env` file.
5. Run The Game:
   ```shell
   python -m sincere_singularities
    ```
