# Game Title Here

Did you ever want to experience the information overload and stress of a phone operator?
Well, then you´re at the right place!

We´ve created the first stressful Discord game, in which you play a phone operator for a restaurant.
No matter what dishes, customers, or special orders you have to serve, don't lose focus, or you might get overwhelmed by the information overload!
