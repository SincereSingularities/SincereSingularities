# Restaurant Rush: Kitchen Chaos

**Sincere Singularities** Python Discord Summer CodeJam 2024 project.
The technology is **Discord Application**, the theme is **Information Overload**, and our chosen framework
is [Disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake/).

---

Did you ever want to experience the information overload and stress of a phone operator?
Well, then you're at the right place!

We've created the first stressful Discord game, in which you play a phone operator for multiple restaurants.
No matter what dishes, customers, or special orders you have to serve, don't lose focus, or you might get overwhelmed by
the information overload!

   git clone https://github.com/SincereSingularities/SincereSingularities/
   cd SincereSingularities
   pip install -e .
   ```
4. Setup and run [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)
5. Set the `BOT_TOKEN`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT` and `DB_NAME` environment variables using the `.env` file.
6. Run The Game:
